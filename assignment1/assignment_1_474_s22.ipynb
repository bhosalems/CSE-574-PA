    "# Programming Assignment 1 - Understanding upvotes on top reddit posts\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this project, you will be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collect and save reddit data using the reddit API (through the ```praw``` library)\n",
    "- Be able to conduct descriptive analyses, via manipulation of data stored in a pandas dataframe, and via the creation and exploration of graphs, of the number of upvotes of reddit comments\n",
    "- Be able to conduct a linear regression to help understand the factors associated with a top post having many upvotes on reddit\n",
    "- **574 Only**: Be able to implement additional feature sets and/or a new model and describe why those decisions were made and what their effects were on performance\n",
    "\n",
    "# Resources you can use to complete this assignment (a COMPLETE list)\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: You ARE allowed to use Google to find things that fit this list (i.e. it is often easy to google something like \"plotly draw line graph\" to find the right part of the plotly documentation).**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anything linked to in this article\n",
    "- Anything linked to from the course web page\n",
    "- Any materials from another online course taught at a university (**if you use this, you MUST provide a link to the exact document used**)\n",
    "- Anything posted by Kenny, Navid, or Yincheng on Piazza\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "- For this assignment, you will need to install the PRAW library for scraping reddit data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three parts to the grading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Written Report (60 points)**: You will submit a PDF report that provides answers to questions here, and that contains plots we request.  These same questions are also posted in the assignment PDF, for convenience. **Again, the questions in the Assignment PDF and here are the same (for the written report), we just put them in both places for convenience.**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Saved file from Part 1.3 (10 points)**: See below for details. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Coding spot checks (30 points)** - We will select 6 problems to spot check. This means that we will check to make sure that your code is written in a reasonable way and that it obtains the desired results when we run your code. For example, your code should not be written in a way that makes it exceedingly slow, e.g. by using for loops where a vectorized approach would be applicable. We will *not* tell you which problems we are spot checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, you will submit, one member of your group will subit as a zip file on UBLearns, a ```.zip``` file that contains 3 things:\n",
    "- Your completed jupyter notebook.\n",
    "- Your written report, answering all questions asked here (and copied in the assignment PDF)\n",
    "- Your saved file from Part 1.3 below"
